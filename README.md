# operation-mercy (WIP)

## Mission
Build a portfolio represented by my favorite childhood video game. Will eventually be moved to my domain (www.waltzimmerman.com). While it's a WIP it will reside [here](http://operationmercy-env.us-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/)

## Tech
- Simple Node.js webserver
- Es6 Client
- Minimal dependencies (so far only Q.js promise lib)

## Overview
I took a town from FF6 and built a collision map representation. I parse the collision map and build a matrix/board that our main character and NPCs can then populate. The main character will walk around the town finding out information about me, representing my profile.


## Todo:
- Add animations
- Get better sprite renderings
- Add Dialog
- Improve matrix scale
- Style
